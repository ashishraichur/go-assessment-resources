-- Describe requirements for the RESOURCES domain for APC. 
-- Design two PostgreSQL tables to store church resources. 
-- The resources may include sermon videos, audio files, PDFs, PPTXs, and eBooks. 
-- Ensure that metadata such as title, description, 
-- resource type, created date, and file path/URL is stored. 
-- Also, ensure that resources can be tagged with multiple categories (e.g., “Sermons,” “Bible Study,” “Worship”).
